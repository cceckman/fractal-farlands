# Fractal Overdrive (aka Fractal Farlands)

See the [paper](Fractal_Overdrive.pdf) for more details.

This was previously "Fractal Farlands", after the Minecraft bug.

To build and run:

-   Get a Cargo toolchain for your platform
-   `cargo run --release --bin ff-web` - you want the optimized build, srsly.
-   Go to the listed port in your web browser (e.g. `localhost:3000`)
